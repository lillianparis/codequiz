challenges. This page will be able to adapt to multiple screen sizes to broaden its
interactivity to a wider audicence than just pc and desktop! This quiz is going to
consist of several multiple choice questions about javascript. This quiz will also
be timed once the user begins. Every question answered wrong will result in a timer
deduction. The quiz is over when the timer stops or all of the questions are answered.
