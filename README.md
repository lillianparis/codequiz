## Description
This webpage is going to feature a multiple-choice question quiz, with interactive
challenges. This page will be able to adapt to multiple screen sizes to broaden its
interactivity to a wider audicence than just pc and desktop! This quiz is going to
consist of several multiple choice questions about javascript. This quiz will also
be timed once the user begins; the score at the end will be determined on the amount
of time it takes the user to complete the quiz. Every question answered wrong will 
result in a 10 second timer deduction. The quiz is over when the timer stops or 
all of the questions are answered. Once the quiz is over the user is prompted to
enter their initials which are saved into the local storage. At the end the user can
view their initials and their score in the console!
